            Ewing Christian College is a preferable choice in Allahabad within its domain of colleges. It is a good college, though every college has some shortcomings, which is universal. When I took admission in this college, I didn’t expect too much from it. I’m currently in my second semester, and it’s set to end next month. I want to share some insights about this college for those considering admission here. If you think I’m going to differentiate this college, you’re right—you need to know what you’re getting into.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first point is about the college faculty, meaning the professors. My subjects are Economics, Geography, and Political Science, and I have friends in every department. You’ll find little information about this college online or on social media, which is why I decided to reveal the truth about it. You might be curious about what kind of truth, so let’s get started.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I begin, I want to share a moment that shocked me. I met a girl on the college campus—eI can’t mention her name due to privacy concerns. She was pretty nice and became my girlfriend in the first semester as we started talking regularly. I was stunned when she told me that, back in 10th grade, her dream was to get admitted to Ewing Christian College. I was shocked by what I heard—she had been dreaming of this college since 10th grade! Reflecting on my own 10th-grade self, I was busy searching for BGMI, Free Fire, and other game hacks. At that time, I didn’t even know what a university or college meant; I thought studies would end after 10th grade. But she… well, that’s another point. This conversation highlights the craze for this college among the local people in this area. So, let’s dive in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The infrastructure of this college is good enough for study purposes, with classrooms featuring traditional seating arrangements like those in school. The second point is about the professors—they are capable of teaching students and know how to do so, but at the same time, some lack the ability to connect effectively. This means there’s a significant understanding gap between certain teachers and students, though this applies only to some. Speaking about all the teachers in this college, they are generally good enough for students and teach well. One of the best teachers here is Nigam Sir from the Economics Department. He teaches us Quantitative Techniques in Economics and has a vast scope of knowledge for students in this field. He’s a genius teacher in the Economics Department and one of the best in the college.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, some faculty members are worse than you can imagine—I’m giving you an outline of this. The main point is, if you’re good at handling pressure, feel free to join this college. If you think this college and its professors aren’t good, you’re mistaken. But if you think they’re great, you’re also wrong. Everything depends on you here. If you perform well, it’ll be good for you; if you don’t perform well academically, it could become a nightmare. I think you can understand what I’m trying to say—whether this college will be good or bad for you depends entirely on you. I’m neither praising nor criticizing this college.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second point is about extracurricular activities—in one line: extracurricular activities are nonexistent here.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ask me about the culture of this college, it’s decent, but not as vibrant as what you might see in other universities.
        </p>
        <p>

One of the most important things about this college is not to trust anyone regarding the exams. The only way to top the exam is by using previous years' question papers (PYQs). Simply get the PYQs from the shop, solve all the questions, and study them thoroughly like a parrot (rote learning). You can top the exams in this college without studying any books or other study materials—it’s like a piece of cake. Rely on PYQs and some class notes; you can manage the class notes with help from your friends. A good strategy with the support of friends can lead you to top this college. Everyone says the exams are very tough, but here, they are a piece of cake because there aren’t many good students. Even the best students or toppers don’t study hard for these exams because they know this degree has little value. Because of this, most students, even the best ones, don’t get good marks. So, don’t worry if you’re concerned about the exams. This paragraph should give you a clear understanding of the exams at Ewing Christian College.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s talk about practicals at Ewing Christian College. The practicals here are decent but can be challenging for the average student. This is common in other universities too, because practicals require prior knowledge of the subject. So, be thoughtful when choosing a practical subject, as it can ruin your college life. (Here, 'college life' refers to your mental peace, nothing more—don’t daydream about a college life like that of IITs or IIMs after getting in. But it’s decent enough for for you.) You can enjoy this college if you’re good at handling mental pressure. One more point: this college will teach you how to handle pressure and people in real life. As for placements, opportunities in B.Com and BCA are almost nonexistent, though there are some exceptions.
